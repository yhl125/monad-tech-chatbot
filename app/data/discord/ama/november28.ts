  Q: Do you remember your first NFT? What is your favorite NFT ever? Have you ever bought a random meme coin because it was funny?

  A (Keone): can't remember if it was my first NFT but definitely one of my first was bastard gans (bgans). i bought them because i saw cobie and ledger talking about how they were bagholding a bunch of them
  they are pretty cool, definitely more interesting looking than the original punks
  but i realize that as a "derivative" collection they're very much a knock off
  then when solana summer (candy machine) happened i kind of went crazy and minted a ton of things
  the thesis on solana NFTs made so much sense... you shouldn't pay hundreds of dollars just in gas fees
  but of course the problem was that the low barrier to entry meant there were tons and tons of low effort collections
  so i minted a bunch of slow rugs
  i think my worst one was minting (and buying on secondary) a bunch of this sloth collection
  the slow patrol

  Q: Can you provide a short pitch to someone who isnt well versed on Monad on how Monad is a L1 despite being EVM compatible? In most cases if a chain is EVM it isnt it considered an L2? (edited)
  [1:42 PM]
  In the same context, is the gas dependent on Mainnet Ethereum?  

  A (fitz): Monad is an L1 because it's a standalone chain that does not post its transactions back to Ethereum. 

  EVM compatible in the context of Monad just means that existing solidity smart contracts that run on the EVM can be deployed on Monad without any changes. Monad adheres to bytecode compatibility.

  Q: What will Monad do to bring Monad-first developers over from it's primary EVM competition (which I assume to be Avalanche C-chain) ?

  A (Keone): i think the biggest competition is traditional tech companies because crypto is so small in comparison. 
  tbh, competition in the crypto space is pretty friendly by normal standards.
  
  i think that a lot of developers are curious to try out something new if there's a real, distinguishing factor, which for Monad is the core technology (the entirely new execution stack, introducing a number of architectural improvements like parallel execution).  in our early interactions with ambitious builders, there has been open-mindedness and curiosity.
  
  as for whether the developers find traction here and build successful startups - that is a matter of execution on the part of our team, as well as the strength of the early community. we will prove that Monad is the most supportive environment for ambitious builders - by offering excellent support on marketing, GTM, fundraising, etc

  Q: I guess let me ask a better question

  Are there plans for there to be a monad conference one day? Similar to how there are Eth and btc and maybe Solana conferences/events?  

  A (Keone): yes i think it's an important part of supporting builders. meeting irl makes a big difference, so from the perspective of getting many ppl together who are collaborating, composing apps, or getting funding... it makes a lot of sense.

  i don't really want a conference to just be a giant party, i think we should be wary of that in crypto, but there's a clear purpose and benefit to the builder community so we will definitely do it

  Q: Do you see monad as a direct solana competitor? or more a competitor to eth ecosystem?

  A (Keone): i think of monad as a part of the eth ecosystem - a different direction to prove out the possibility of much greater scalability at the base layer. ethereum ethos is about decentralization, which means different teams trying different things.  monad takes a different direction than others, which is needed to show what's possible.  from recent conferences i've been to, it can feel like literally everyone is working on zkEVMs, which makes doing something different even more important
  we can't know what the right direction is unless we try different things
  as to the question about direct competition, as in competition for developers or competition for mindshare -- i mean i think that even within the broader ethereum ecosystem there is going to be a lot of competition, e.g. between various L2s. or between eth DA and other DA sources like celestia or eigenDA. so i think if you look at it in the narrow sense, yes there will be competition between monad and some L2.
  monad is not seeking to replace ethereum - that's not realistic or productive. if anything, the existence of monad can be beneficial for ethereum/crypto overall

  Q: What are Monad’s plan to further spread awareness and adoption of Web3 in the traditional Web2 world?


  A (fitz): I think a lot of this may happen naturally when the dapps that mimic performance of Web2 venues pop up on mainnet. So long as onchain orderbooks have healthy flows, market makers/prop shops  will want to be there. Once that happens, word spreads pretty quickly & helps to bring more traditional trading folks in.

  Q: What are Monad’s plan to further spread awareness and adoption of Web3 in the traditional Web2 world?

  A (ZenLlama): Traditional routes of engagement like Hackathons, ect… are a first step and will be part of the strategy. However, the true test is breaking into the minds of Web2 developers in general. The sense from a lot of Web2 builders is that Blockchains can’t scale or that developing on them is overly complicated. This comes from much of the discourse in Web3 to date being centered on scaling the base chain rather than enabling new experiences. We talk a lot about new experiences in the abstract as part of Web3 but without showing examples of these things, its often met with skepticism as to what the experience actually looks like when you have to deal with the scaling issues of Web3. Thus, to appeal to Web2 builders we need to showcase the features that will allow them to create new experiences so they can focus on App ideation rather than scaling problems. The idea is to showcase what is possible using Monad to dispell this idea that Blockchains aren’t ready for mass adoption. One way to do this is just to showcase dApps on Monad that feel like Web2, to show Web2 developers that good UX is possible when using a Blockchain. Other ways will involve some sort of developer marketing, where we can showcase how to do things using various blockchain dApp primitives to create new experiences. Basically, we gotta show Web2 devs whats possible and not place the scaling problem front and center. Showing them, scaling is Monad’s job, your job is to create cool Apps.

  Q: How much is the gas cost per transaction of monad going to be set? I think gas costs should also be reduced a lot for mass adoption. Currently, among EVM compatible chains, L2 is performing well, but the gas cost is still too high, and in the case of the Polygon chain, the gas cost is very low, but I personally feel that it is too slow.

  A (Keone): it'll be set using a priority gas auction with a floor price, as the clearing price for an auction between (initially) small demand and huge supply would otherwise be 0 which would result in spam attacks. BSC does something similar (they set a floor of 3 gwei last i checked)
  we expect the cost of a 150k gas transaction like a UniV2 swap to be on the order of $0.0015, but the exact amount is dependent on the exact floor parameter as well as some other factors

  Q: What are your thoughts on AI and technological singularity? Is it achievable in our lifetime? Do you think it is exciting or scary?

  A (Keone): it seems inevitable that machines become capable of full thought, since our brains are literally just physical structures. it's definitely concerning. also given the speed of innovation and the fact that we have been evolving for millions of years... feels like in less than 1000 we will definitely have full AGI
  i guess the question is whether the AGI will be able to manufacture chips (or whatever the constraint is for its own intellgence) on their own
  it would be funny if the AGI had similar supply chain problems to the rest of us with respect to not being able to get NVIDIA chips
  i think that securing access to chips is probably the biggest way to protect against AGI takeover. those manufactories are very hard to build so i dont think a rogue AGI could build one in secret just using a bunch of raw manufacturing processes (which i assume will be easier to get access to on the public market)

  a problem i see is that while there are a lot of developers entering hackathons from the international community, the VC community is still very biased toward US founders

  Q: What is your opinion of the current Monad lore, what do you like and what do you find not so funny or interesting?

  A (Keone): i think it's incredible. creative acts always seem simple in retrospect but if you try to be creative it's actually incredibly hard to be interesting but not cringe
  a related story is that we spent a lot of time within the team in the early days trying to think of a better mascot than the purple pepe.

  the pepe is great because he captures a lot of things that i think we can all relate to - he's kind of diminutive, pathetic, sad.  the fact that posting him is kind of an act of self-deprecation is crucial.  and then features-wise, the eyes and the mouth are extremely recognizable
  but when we looked at other projects' mascots, they kind of missed the mark in that they weren't very memorable. examples being sui's teardrop, avalanche's red... guy

  A (tunez): benefit of the pepe is there are already 100,000+ pepe memes which anyone can re-purpose into a monad meme
  vs. a custom character that limits scale
  
  A (Keone): at the end of the day, i think that it is best for the community to converge on a mascot(s) over a long period of time
  but also, when we started we were like "we need a mascot" because everyone had a mascot
  which is the wrong thinking to begin with
  rather than creating a mascot in order to have a mascot, it should be more like, i use this character as part of a means of communication because he represents something
  and why he represents that could have evolved over a long time
