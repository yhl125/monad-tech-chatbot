  [Monad Labs](https://monadlabs.xyz/) is accelerating the Ethereum Virtual Machine so that decentralized apps can eat the world.
  
  The EVM is the ubiquitous standard of web3; over [96%](https://defillama.com/languages) of all capital in DeFi is in EVM apps. In spite of this, EVM-compatible blockchains have extremely low throughput: Ethereum supports roughly 10 transactions per second, and no EVM rollup is over [50 tps](https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity).
  
  We are solving this problem with **[Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/)**, the performant Layer-1 blockchain that introduces parallel execution and superscalar pipelining to the EVM. 
  
  Deep optimization is needed across all levels of the stack - from the database layer, to the virtual machine layer, to the consensus and networking layer - in order to streamline EVM transaction processing. Monad introduces these low-level optimizations, allowing consumer-grade hardware to deliver exceptional performance while maintaining a high degree of decentralization.
  
  **Today, we are thrilled to announce our $225M fundraise, led by [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/).** This funding milestone gives us ample resources to continue scaling our team and to bring Monad to production.
